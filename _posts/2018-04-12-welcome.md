This is the first post on an open internal You.i Dev and UX blog.

To add a post, follow these steps:

1. Clone {{ site.github.repository_url }}:
`git clone {{ site.github.repository_url }}`
2. Add a new post in _posts/ (the other files in that folder can be referred to):
`vi _posts/2018-04-14-all-about-foo.md`
3. If this is your first time posting, also edit `_data/authors.yml` to add yourself to the authors list.
4. Add the file to the git index and commit:
`git add -A && git commit -m "Added post about foo"`
5. Push your local branch to the upstream repository:
`git push origin master`

Posts use markdown syntax -- pretty much the same as Slack formatting.

Jekyll is used to render pages, and Jekyll-specific stuff can be used. See [this page](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/) for details.

Images can be added by either linking to a publically-hosted file or by putting a file in assets/img/ and linking to it there.

Code snippets can be provided by using the `single backticks` method or by using the

```
triple backticks method.
```

Syntax highlighting can also be done using the triple backticks method, which is way shorter to type:

```c++
if (false)
{
    panic();
}
```

Posts can be previewed locally by installing and running the Jekyll gems:

1. `cd site_folder`
2. `bundle install`
3. `bundle exec jekyll serve`
4. Open web browset at [http://http://127.0.0.1:4000/](http://http://127.0.0.1:4000/)

The local server will automatically regenerate the pages when the source files are updated.
